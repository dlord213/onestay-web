# OneStay Admin Panel

Welcome to the OneStay Admin Panel, a comprehensive web application designed for resort owners to manage their property, reservations, rooms, and guest communications.
This dashboard provides a centralized, real-time hub for all administrative tasks, from viewing sales reports to updating resort details on an interactive map.

## ✨ Features
- **Dashboard**: An overview of key statistics, including average ratings, total rooms, and reservation counts.
- **Resort Management**: Edit resort details (name, description, image) and pinpoint the exact location using an interactive Leaflet map.
- **Room Management**: Add, view, and manage all rooms associated with the resort, including type, capacity, price, and status.
- **Reservation Management**: View a filterable list of all guest reservations (pending, confirmed, completed, etc.) and drill down into individual booking details.
- **Guest Management**: See a complete list of all guests who have made reservations.
- **Live Chat**: A real-time chat system (powered by Socket.io) for communicating directly with guests.
- **Reporting**: Generate dynamic reports on monthly sales and room type popularity, complete with chart visualizations (recharts) and a "Export to PDF" feature.
- **Account Settings**: Securely update profile information and change passwords within the application.
